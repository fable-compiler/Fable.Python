# Learning the language

There are many resources available to learn F#. This section is only intended as a general guide targeted to JS developers, but is mainly contribution-driven and is still a work in progress. If you already know the basics of the language you can skip to [the next section](../2-steps/setup.html) or you can also check other sites and books about F# like:

- [Tour of F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour)
- [F# for Fun and Profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/)
- [F# Software Foundation](https://fsharp.org/)
- [Get Programming with F#](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp) (book)
