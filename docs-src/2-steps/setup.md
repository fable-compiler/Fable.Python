# Setup

## Prerequisites

In order to use Fable you will need the following tools:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to work with F# files and dependencies
- [Python](https://python.org/) to execute Python code
- A Python package manager, like [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Having the above tools, you may consider using [Femto](https://fable.io/blog/2019/2019-06-29-Introducing-Femto.html) to
ease package management.

## Development tools

Basically you will need an editor that lets you code in F# with features like hints on hover, autocomplete, syntax
highlighting and so on... and there are many of them to suit your code styling!
